The purpose of this project is to render server-side Highchart and return
the result as an svg string.

The basic idea is to send data through to the amazing phantomjs
(http://www.phantomjs.org/) to handle the rendering and return the content.


Requrirements:
1. Webserver capable of executing PHP scripts
2. phantomjs cabale of being run in 'headless' mode (it will be exec'd by the
   webserver after all).  I built qt-webkit 4.8 with -qpa as an option.


This service accepts 1 required param
$_REQUEST['chart'] //json data to be passed to Highcharts.Chart(<<HERE>>);
the chart must:
chart.renderTo = 'container'
chart.renderer = 'SVG'

and should kill all animations/interactive components.

optional params

$_REQUEST['ignore_servify'] //place you in control of killing animations and setting proper container/renderer etc
$_REQUEST['theme'] //allows you to override the default theme (optionally set in config.ini)
$_REQUEST['format'] //jpg/png return raw binary image data instead of svg+xml
$_REQUEST['convert_args'] //additional args to be passed to 'convert' in transformation to image format above
$_REQUEST['width'] //hard-coded image width
$_REQUEST['height'] //hard-coded image height


There is a basic config.ini.sample file included which *must* be copied to config.ini
and at least set the phantomjs_path parameter.
